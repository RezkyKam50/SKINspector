A. Visual Description:
- **Primary Morphology:** Papule
- **Color & Shape:** Brown, round

1. **Topical Therapy:** Topical corticosteroids can be used to reduce inflammation and itching. Examples include hydrocortisone cream or clobetasol cream.
2. **Surgical Removal:** If the lesion is concerning for malignancy, surgical excision may be necessary. This should be performed by a dermatologist or surgeon.
