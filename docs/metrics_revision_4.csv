The image shows a small, round, slightly elevated lesion with a central black spot, surrounded by a red halo. The surrounding skin appears normal without any visible lesions or changes. This pattern is characteristic of a melanocytic nevus, specifically a junctional nevus. The central black spot is the melanin pigment, which is typically darker than the surrounding skin. The red halo is due to the inflammatory reaction around the nevus. 

**Most Likely Diagnosis:** Junctional Nevus (Melanocytic Nevus)

**Medical Treatment Options:**
1. **Topical Therapy:** Topical imiquimod cream (5% or 7%) can be used to treat junctional nevi. It works by stimulating the immune system to recognize and destroy the nevus cells. Apply twice daily for 12 weeks, then taper off over 6 months.
2. **Surgical Removal:** For larger nevi or those causing cosmetic concerns, surgical removal (e.g., shave biopsy, punch excision) may be necessary. This procedure involves removing the nevus completely, which is often done under local anesthesia.
