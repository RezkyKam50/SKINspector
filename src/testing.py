Basalcellcarcinoma(p.): In most instances this is a malignant tumor of hair follicle origin. Most tumors occur in sun-exposed skin, but are rare on the back of the hands (high sun exposure) and also occur on nonexposed skin. Patients with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome have a mutation in the PTCH gene and numerous basal cell carcinomas; the same mutation is seen in sporadic basal cell carcinoma. Malignant melanoma (p.): Has been increasing dramatically in inci- dence; the rate in Australia is now –/ year and in Western Europe

Incidence has doubled over past two decades. Most patients are/H1102250years of age. Pathogenesis: The cell of origin of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) has long been argued. Since it is the most commonhumanmalignancy,thequestionisnotinsignificant.MostBCCarisefrom epidermal cells differentiated in the direction of the primitive hair bulb.

maintriggerappearstobeUVB,butthisisnottheonlyfactor,becauseBCCsareex- tremely uncommon on the backs of the hands where actinic keratoses are frequent. The underlying genetic mutations in Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) frequently involve thePATCH gene or other members of the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway, resulting in overexpressionoftranscriptionfactorGli1,assuggestedbyresearchinnevoidBCC syndrome. Clinicalfeatures: Note: Key unifying clinical features of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) include pearly nodules and telan- giectases; always look for these (Fig.6a).

to lateral aspects of palms and soles. Histology: Marked damage to elastic fibers. Differential diagnosis: Punctate porokeratosis and focal acral hyperkeratosis, which is clinically identical but shows no elastic fiber defects on biopsy. LinearorStripedLesions The usual explanation for linear or striped lesions ismosaicism—a common genetic phenomenon. During human development, the skin moves in a peculiar fashion to coverthegrowingtrunkandlimbs,producingapatternknownas Blaschkolines.An y time there is a mutation in a somatic gene during the early stages of development, linear lesions are produced, whether it be epidermal nevi (mutations in keratins or otherepidermalgrowthcontrolgenes),largepigmentednevi,orothers.Everyfemale

Definition: Congenital absence of skin and often subcutaneous tissue; may be solitary or associated with a long list of rare syndromes. Pathogenesis: Probably represents somatic mosaicism, as lines often follow Blaschko lines. Clinicalfeatures: Most common presentation is punched-out ulcer on vertex of scalp (%); –2cm with erythematous base. Usually birth trauma is suspected, so docu- mentation is crucial to avoid misunderstandings (and lawsuits). Heals with scarring and permanent alopecia.

Perforat- ing folliculitis is an oxymoron, as all folliculitis shows some degree of follicle wall damagebydefinition.Thesepatientshavepruritusinducedbytheirrenaldisease (oroccasionallybyotherfactors),andreactwithafolliculartypeofprurigonodu- laris. Clinical features: Intense pruritus; numerous –6mm hyperkeratotic nodules, usually clearly in a follicle, are seen on the shins, forearms, and sometimes else- where on the body. Areas with no follicles, such as palms, soles, and mucosa are spared. Histology: Highly confusing; varying combinations of follicular plugging, follicle wall damage, reactive epidermal changes, excoriations, chronic inflammation. Diagnosticapproach: Clinical examination and history.

When confronted with a patient with vulvar dermatitis, the two most important is- sues are: Presence of vaginal discharge with irritation. Evidence of underlying skin disease such as: Atopicdermatitis: Manywomenwithchronicvulvardermatitishaveotherstig- mata of atopic dermatitis. Psoriasis: Classic intertriginous disease, may involve vulva almost exclusively; look for other clues (nails, scalp). Some rare diseases also regularly involve the vulva. Examples include necrolytic migratory erythema as a marker for glucagonoma and acrodermatitis enter- opathica as a sign of zinc deficiency. Note: Always consider nutritionaldeficiencies and eating disorders when con- fronted with vulvar dermatitis. Therapy: Treatment is based on identifying and correcting the underlying dis-

Many other co-factors are involved, such as exposure to other forms of ionizing radiation, heat, trauma and chemical carcinogens, certain scars (such as those as- sociated with tuberculosis and osteomyelitis), immunosuppression, and selected pre-existing dermatoses such as mucosal lichen planus or lichen sclerosus.
